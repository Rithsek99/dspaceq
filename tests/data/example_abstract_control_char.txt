Non-Newtonian fluids are very common during drilling, fracture 
operations and enhanced oil recovery processes. When a reservoir contains a nonNewtonian fluid such as those injected during polymer flood or the production of 
heavy oil, well test data cannot be interpreted using Newtonian fluid flow models. 
The resulting analysis would be erroneous because non-Newtonian fluids behave 
rather differently. 

These results suggest the need for a thorough study of the behavior of nonNewtonian fluids in the reservoir and also a new look at the flow of those fluids in 
porous media. 

This study presents an interpretation technique for pressure behavior of 
non-Newtonian fluid flow in a homogeneous reservoir without type-curve 
Matching. The inclusion of a no-flow and/or a constant pressure line is also 
investigated. 

First, the TSD (Tiab's Direct Synthesis) technique was applied for 
analyzing the pressure behavior of a well located in (1) an infinite reservoir and, 
(2) near a linear boundary where wellbore storage and skin effects were 
considered. The analysis required the generation of type-curve sets for different 
wellbore storage and skin values. 


A step-by-step procedure is presented for the calculation of the reservoir 
parameters: the permeability/viscosity ratio, wellbore storage coefficient, skin 
factor and the distance to the nearest boundary without the use of type-curve 
Matching. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example.
